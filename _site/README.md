Minima with Sidebar TOC
-----------------------

Minima is the default theme for Jekyll and Github Pages.  It does just about 
everything I need... except the Table of Contents is inline with the content. 
I want the TOC out of the way, on the sidebar.  And that's what this repo does.

More docs and examples are on [Github Pages][home].
